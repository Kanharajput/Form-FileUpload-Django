"# FormInDjango" 

FORM METHODS:
- form has by default GET method to submit data
    - GET method is used to get the data from the server and create an url e.g. http://localhost:8000/?username=kanha , here username is the field and kanha is the data passed in the field. It also create key value but that is passed with Query String Parameter

    - POST method is used to send the data to the server and it don't attach field and it's data to the url rather then this key-value pair is passed in the form data, check this difference through network panel provided in developer tools window.
